📚 Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) Practice

Welcome to my DSA Practice repository!
This repo contains my implementations of fundamental Data Structures, Algorithms, and related coding exercises using JavaScript.
I created this space to track my progress, improve problem-solving skills, and build strong DSA foundations.

🚀 Purpose of This Repository

To practice DSA consistently

To understand core mechanics by building everything from scratch

To improve problem-solving & logical thinking

To prepare for coding interviews

To keep all practice code organized in one place

🛠️ Technologies Used

JavaScript (ES6+)

Node.js (optional for running scripts)

VS Code
